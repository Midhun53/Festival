    <h1>DIWALI: THE FESTIVAL OF LIGHTS</h1>
    <img src="diwali.jpg" style="width: 500px; height: 700px;" alt="Diwali">
    <p>
        Diwali, or Dipawali, is India's biggest and most important holiday of the year. The festival
        gets its name from the row (avali) of clay lamps (deepa) that Indians light outside their homes
        to symbolize the inner light that protects from spiritual darkness. This festival is as important
        to Hindus as the Christmas holiday is to Christians. Over the centuries, Diwali has become a
        national festival that's also enjoyed by non-Hindu communities. For instance, in Jainism,
        Diwali marks the nirvana, or spiritual awakening, of Lord Mahavira on October 15, 527 B.C.;
        in Sikhism, it honors the day that Guru Hargobind Ji, the Sixth Sikh Guru, was freed from
        imprisonment. Buddhists in India celebrate Diwali as well.

    <p>
        Holi is a popular and significant Hindu festival celebrated as the Festival of Colours, Love,
        and Spring. It celebrates the eternal and divine love of the deities Radha and Krishna.
        Additionally, the day signifies the triumph of good over evil, as it commemorates the victory
        of Vishnu as Narasimha over Hiranyakashipu. Holi originated and is predominantly celebrated
        in the Indian subcontinent, but has also spread to other regions of Asia and parts of the Western
        world through the Indian diaspora.

    <h1>ONAM: THE HARVEST FESTIVAL OF KERALA</h1>
    <img src="onam.jpg" style="width: 500px; height: 700px;" alt="Onam">
    <p>
        The festival of Onam is celebrated throughout the state of Kerala. Kerala during Onam is
        marked by happiness, excitement, and enjoyment among all sections of people. Onam is
        celebrated as an outcome of reasons that have to do with mythology as well as old agrarian
        practices. If one is to go by the myth, then King Mahabali or Maveli was a generous and
        virtuous ruler, who had once ruled Kerala. This occasion is celebrated by all Keralites as Onam.
        And the other cause for celebrating Onam is because it is the time of the year when a good
        harvest has been gathered all over Kerala, resulting in plenitude and happiness.
